add labs to patient schema
consider adding internal ids as available
check that dates and times are included in all relevant categories
create separate jsons for each patient, make sure each is formatted in readable way

create category level schemas for each document type
design templates (probably in word) for versions of each doc type
create json templates for each version of a document type (e.g. visit_summary_a vs visit_summary_b)

create patient->document mapping ground truth
